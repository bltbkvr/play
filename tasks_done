Transition { currentState: 0, event: Increment, nextState: 1 }
Change { currentState: 0, nextState: 1 }??? How does the event Infer that in is Increment

Ne ponyal bloc selector

questions for discussion:
What does testable mean in means of code?
Why not use Cubit.state?


???Note: await Future.delayed(Duration.zero) is added for
this example to avoid canceling the subscription immediately.

should never does not mean it is not possible???Blocs should never directly emit new states. Instead every state change must be
 output in response to an incoming event within an EventHandler.


Both blocs and cubits will ignore duplicate states. If we emit State
 nextState where state == nextState, then no state change will occur.
